# Import blocks for existing resources to prevent conflicts
# These will be used if resources already exist from previous runs

# Import existing CloudFront Origin Access Controls if they exist
# Terraform will automatically handle these during plan/apply

# Note: Import blocks are available in Terraform 1.5+
# For older versions, the script will use terraform import commands
